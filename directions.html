            <h1>Design directions for our application</h1>
            <h2>Prioritize clarity</h2>
            <p>
                Our application focuses on clarity by providing high visual contrast,
                large text and buttons, as well as responsive features. Images on
                a page are large, and those that are clickable expand when hovered. Each
                functionality on the page is centered, and we dedicate a single page to every
                individual feature. We want to lead users to their goals without distracting them. 
                The presence of excessive links or images will only divert them from whatever 
                task they're performing. 
            </p>
            <h2>Promote scannability</h2>
            <p>
                Our minimalist design allows users to find what they're looking for, fast.
                Large but short text as well as simple, consistent terminology allows users
                to scan the pages quickly and effectively. 
            </p>
            <h2>Avoid restrictions</h2>
            <p>
                Our application doesn't force users to perform any unnatural tasks. One of 
                such tasks is having to consider password restrictions, which makes 
                passwords hard to remember. 
            </p>
            <h2>Easy navigation</h2>
            <p>
              All of the main features can be easily found through the navigation bar. 
              The navigation bar does not contain self-links. We have designed it
              to highlight the page which the user is currently on. This will help
              the user remember where in the application they are.
