            <h2>Minimalist design</h2>
            <p>
                Our website has designed to ensure that our webpage has a small
                number of features so that the user does not get distracted.
            </p>
            <h2>Logo</h2>
            <p>
              The logo of our application has been featured prominently on the
              webpage. This will help users recognize our website and application easily.
              This way it can be distinguished from other applications.
            </p>
            <h2>Easy navigation</h2>
            <p>
              Our website is easy to navigate with a prominent navigation bar.
              The navigation bar does not contain self-links. We have designed it
              to highlight the page which the user is currently on. This will help
              the user remember where in the application they are.
