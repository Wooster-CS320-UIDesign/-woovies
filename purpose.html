            <h1>Why create WOO-VIES?</h1>
            <p>Despite the abundance of streaming services available, most people have a hard time figuring out what they want to watch.
                Some find themselves wasting more time endlessly scrolling for the next movie rather than spend time watching it.
               WOO-VIES seeks to make this process easy and effortless, by providing a recommendation system that is tailored to the userâ€™s preferences.
               Although most streaming services do have built-in recommendation systems, they draw from a limited collection of content and
               thus do not always provide relevant recommendations. We believe users need a separate application that can provide a wider collection of films
               and TV shows for users to choose from.
