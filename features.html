            <h1>Features</h1>
            <p>WOO-VIES is a simple recommendation app with all the necessary features for users to obtain recommendations
              from and keep track of the movies or TV shows they want to watch. The recommendation system is
              based on the genres users frequently search for and add to their watchlist. Immediately on the
              appâ€™s home page, users will be given a set of recommendations. Accompanied with this recommendation
              system is a large collection of movies and TV shows as well as a search feature that allows you
              to manually look for the films you like and add them to your watchlist. This gives the user
              some flexibility and allows the app to improve on its recommendations. The idea is that the more you
              search for movies through the app and add things to your watchlist, the more accurate the recommendations will
              be. Another feature is the profile and login, which ensures that
              the watchlist will be saved and specific to the user. In addition to all these features, users
              have the option of changing their username and password.</p>
