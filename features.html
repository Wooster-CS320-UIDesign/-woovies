            <h1>Features</h1>
            <p>WOO-VIES is a simple recommendation app with all the necessary features for users to obtain recommendations
              from and keep track of the movies or TV shows they want to watch. Our application offers the following
              features to its users:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li> <b>Search</b>: Users can search for movies and TV shows they want to watch.
                As of now, the title of content should be entered accurately in order to get search results.
              <li> <b>Filter</b>: Users can select filters that they want to apply to the search. Currently,
                    users can select filters but it does not have an effect on the search.
              <li> <b>Profile</b>: Users must create an account in order to use the application. Under
                the Profile menu, there are options to change the username and password.
              <li> <b>Recommendations</b>: Recommendations for users will be provided for content that
                they might be interested in. Currently, the recommendations are the same irrespective of
                the credentials used to login to the application.
              <li> <b>Watchlist</b>: Movies and TV shows can be added to the watchlist. The idea behind
                this is that every account will be linked to its watchlist. Movies can be easily removed
                from the watchlist. All content in the watchlist will be visible under the Watchlist tab.
              <li> <b>Authentication</b>: Users can login to application or create a new account. The only
                requirements to creating an account or logging in are a username and password. The way the
                application is implemented right now, the user can login without entering any text for username
                and password. Even if login credentials are entered, no verification is performed in the
                background.
