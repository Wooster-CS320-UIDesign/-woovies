            <h1>Why create WOO-VIES?</h1>
            <p>Despite the abundance of streaming services available, most people have a hard time figuring out what they want to watch.
                Some find themselves wasting more time endlessly scrolling for the next movie rather than spend time watching it.
               WOO-VIES seeks to make this process easy and effortless, by providing a recommendation system that is tailored to the user’s preferences.
               Although most streaming services do have built-in recommendation systems, they draw from a limited collection of content and
               thus do not always provide relevant recommendations. We believe users need a separate application that can provide a wider collection of films
               and TV shows for users to choose from.

        <div id="features">
            <h1>Features</h1>
            <p>WOO-VIES is a simple recommendation app with all the necessary features for users to obtain recommendations
              from and keep track of the movies or TV shows they want to watch. The recommendations system is
              based on the genres users frequently search for and add to their watchlist. Immediately on the
              app’s home page, users will be given a set of recommendations that are changed
              (daily?weekly?how frequently idk we gotta talk about this). Accompanied with this recommendation
              system is a large collection of movies and TV shows as well as a search feature that allows you
              to manually look for the films you like and add them to your watchlist. This gives the user
              some flexibility and allows the app to improve on its recommendations. The idea is that the more you
              search for movies through the app and add things to your watchlist, the more accurate the recommendations will
              be (we gotta talk about this too). Another feature is the profile and login, which ensures that 
              the watchlist will be saved and specific to the user. </p>
